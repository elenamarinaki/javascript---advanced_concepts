### Execution Context ðŸ”«

- When JS sees the `()` of a function, it creates an _Execution Context_.
- Execution context is **added to the stack**.
- The basic execution context that runs is called the _Global Execution Context_.
  - first layer => `global()`

ðŸ¤” _Whenever code runs in JS, it runs in an execution context. True or False?_
True! All code is part of an execution context; either global or part of some function.
