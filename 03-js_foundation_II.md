# JavaScript Foundation II

### Execution Context üî´

- When JS sees the `()` of a function, it creates an _Execution Context_.
- Execution context is **added to the stack**.
- The basic execution context that runs is called the _Global Execution Context_.
  - first layer => `global()`

#### ü§î _Whenever code runs in JS, it runs in an execution context. True or False?_

True! All code is part of an execution context; either global or part of some function.

- The Global Execution Context gives us:
  - a `global object`
  - the keyword `this`
  - `Hoisting`

#### ü§î _Is `this` the same as `window`?_

Yes!

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è In Node.JS the `window` is called `global`!

- We can assign variables to the global object. This is where the `creation phase` ends. üé®
- Then comes the `execution phase`, when we actually run our code. üå™Ô∏è
- A _Function Execution Context_ is added above the global one every time we have a new function (and the stack gets created). üß±

### Lexical Environment üìö

- a.k.a. Lexical Scope, Lexical Analysis
- It refers to _where we write something_, every time we create an execution context.
- Compilers are doing lexical analysis => where is the location of the words, in which execution context are there to be found.
- Every function offers a different execution context, hence a new lexical environment is created.
- üí° _Execution context tells you which lexical environment is currently running._
- In JS, our **lexical scope** (available data + variables where the function was defined) determines our available variables. _Not where the function is called_ (dynamic scope)!
- First lexical environment => Global Lexical Environment

### Hoisting ü™¢

- Allocate space in our memory heap, to make sure the engine is ready for the execution.
- The moving the variables or function declarations on the top of their respective environment.
- JS allocates memory for the variables and functions during the creation phase before it executes it.
- **Functions are fully hoisted in javascript**. This is _not true for variables_, where the name is reserved, but the value is not assigned during hoisting.
- ### ‚ö†Ô∏è
  From the variables, only the `var` gets hoisted! E.g. if we try to use a variable before its declaration with `let`, it will show `undefined`!
- Function declarations VS function expressions:
  - Declaration:
  ```js
  function sing() {
    console.log('do re mi!');
  }
  ```
  - Expression:
  ```js
  var sing2 = function () {
    console.log('la si do!');
  };
  ```
  During the creation phase, the `sing2` is going to be hoisted and assigned `undefined`, until its execution phase. So, I cannot call it before its line of declaration.
